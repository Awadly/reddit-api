# Reddit Info Display Project

This project is aimed at displaying information from the subreddit "flutter" using a Node.js backend and a React frontend. The frontend is included as a separate folder within the repository and needs to be run independently.

## Backend Setup Instructions

Backend (Node.js)

1- Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Awadly/reddit-api.git
```

2- Navigate to the backend directory.


3- Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4- Run the backend 
```bash
npm start
```

## Frontend Setup instructions

1- Navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

2- Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3- Start the React development server: 
```bash
npm start
```

## Accessing the Application
Once both the backend and frontend servers are running, you can access the application by visiting http://localhost:3000 in your web browser. The frontend will communicate with the backend to fetch and display information from the "flutter" subreddit.
